# Status

Command-line status update system

## Usage

```typescript
// A new manager. Nothing happens yet.
const cm = new StatusManager();
// Start the status area, though still nothing is printed
cm.start()
// Update items by keys that you invent.  As you add unique ones, they are added
// and console space is allocated without overwriting existing console messages.
cm.update(2, "my status")
// Logging still works -- gets "prepended" before the status area
console.log("This doesn't overwrite anything.")
// Adjust how often the screen refreshes (status updates are batched)
cm.screenRefreshRateMs = 250
// Stop the status area; subsequent logging goes under it
cm.stop()
```
